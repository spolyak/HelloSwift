### Exercise

Consider a car.  What attributes and properties of a car could we capture using variables and constants? Which attributes would be mutable and which would be immutable?

Create variables and constants for the following attributes of a car, and then print each one.

1.  paintColor
2.  make
3.  model
4.  year
5.  isManualTransmission
6. seats
7. mileage
*/

var paintColor = "red"

let model = "Nova"
let year = 1969
let isManualTransmission = true
let seats = 4
var mileage = 250000
print (make)
print (model)
